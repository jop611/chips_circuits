# Chips & Circuits
The assignment is to connect gates with a fixed arrangement with each other according to a given netlist.
Connections can only follow the grid. This includes the edge of the grid. 1 step on the grid is one unit length.
The grid exists of 7 layers. This means that connections can also go up and down. This costs 1 unit length per level.
All connections of each netlist need to be made at minimum cost.

The example below shows how the connections A-B, A-C,C-E, D-B, D-E are being made with as little steps as possible.

 **Constraints**

 - Wires can not run along the same grid segment
 - Wires can not cross at an intersection
 - Wires can not go outside of the grid, 17x12 for print 1 and 17x16 for print 2

## Prerequisites
This code has been written in [Python3.7.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In requirements.txt are all the required packages to successfully use the code. This includes the matplotlib and json packages. These can be downloaded by following the following function:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure


## Algorithms
For this problem 3 algorithms were used:
* A*
* Hillclimber
* Breadth First

Due to the A*-algorithm pushing the connections up to make all connections, the wire length becomes unnecessery long by not using the lower levels. The Hillclimber algorithm improves the solution found by A* by recreating the made connections on the lower levels.

**Heuristic**

The netlists are sorted by the average amount of connections coming to or from the gate

## Testing
To use this code you first run:
```bash
python main.py
```
After choosing your preferred algorithm. You can chose A for A*, B for Breadth first. Further you will be asked to chose between chip 1 and 2 and then for a netlist. 1-3 for chip 1 and 4-6 for chip 2. The code will now look for a solution for the chosen netlist.

Option C for Hillclimber can be chosen after first running either A* or Breadth First first. The Hillclimber algorithm will try to lower the connection cost of the already made netlist by A* or Breadth First if possible.

Below an example of the results given by A* and after running that solution through Hillclimber

At the end of each search a window will pop up with a visualisation of the found solution containing all gates and the connections between them as shown above.
