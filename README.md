# Chips & Circuits
Chips are made out of silicone plates. You can find gates on these plates which interact with each other by connecting them. By connecting them with each other, electricity can flow between the gates & a circuit is created. You can connect gates in various ways, whereby a netlist shows which gates should be connected to each other. However it doesn't show how the gates should be connected to each other.

The assignment is to connect gates with a fixed arrangement with each other according to a given netlist. Because you have a lot of possibilities to make these connections, we need to find the minimum total length of each netlist.
The advantage of this is that you minimalize the costs & that you speed up the circuits.
Connections can only follow the grid. This includes the edge of the grid. 1 step on the grid is one unit length.
The grid exists of 7 layers. This means that connections can also go up and down. This costs 1 unit length per level.
Wires can also not cross at an intersection & they can not run along the same grid segment. All these constraints are shown below.

The example below shows how the connections A-B, A-C,C-E, D-B, D-E are being made with as little steps as possible.

The example below shows how the connections A-B, A-C,C-E, D-B, D-E are being made inefficiently.

 ### Constraints 

 - Wires can not run along the same grid segment
 - Wires can not cross at an intersection
 - Wires can not go outside of the grid, 17x12 for print 1 and 17x16 for print 2

## Prerequisites
This code has been written in [Python3.7.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In requirements.txt are all the required packages to successfully use the code. This includes the matplotlib and json packages. These can be downloaded by following the following function:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure
In the code folder you can find the algorithms and classes folders.
You can find several pathfinding algorithms in the algorithms folder.
The **breadth first** algorithm tries to find a path by checking every possible option beginning from the node.
The **a-star** algorithm finds his way through the grid by looking at his neighbours. Some neighbours are more favorable moving to then others & the algorithm is designed to move to the most favourable neighbour.
The **hillclimber** algorithm is designed to act after a netlist is successfully connected. The **hillclimber** algorithm breaks every connection step by step & tries to make a shorter connection without the use of some heuristics used in the **a-star** algorithm.

You can find the print & netlist file in the classes folder that are partly operated in the beginning.
The **netlist** file loads the netlist that is selected with the manhattan distance per connection & the **print** file loads the gates with their corresponding coordinates.
The **netlist** file also contains some helping functions that are used in the 3 algorithms.

The pics folder contains all the pictures used in the README.md file

The gates&netlists folder contains 2 folders: **chip_1** & **chip_2**. Each of these folders contain all the netlists and gate positions of the corresponding chip. Chip 1, netlist 0 is our own made netlist for the testing of Breadth First.

The results folder is divided into 2 folders: **print_1** & **print_2**. Each of these folders is divided into **a_star** &  **hillclimb**.
These folders contain the results obtained from running the program depending on which netlist you choose. An example of a result can be: netlist_1_719.
The first number after the first underscore represent the netlist that was used. The second number after the second underscore represent the score.
If you click on these result files you can see the order in which the netlist was solved. After that you can see the path of each connection and at the end you can see the heuristics that were used to obtain the result.

For more information on these files, click on them.

## Algorithms
For this problem 3 algorithms were used:
* A*
* Hillclimber
* Breadth First

Due to the A*-algorithm pushing the connections up to make all connections, the wire length becomes unnecessary long by not using the lower levels. The Hillclimber algorithm improves the solution found by A* by recreating the made connections on the lower levels.

**Heuristic**

The netlists are sorted by the average amount of connections coming to or from the gate

## Testing
To use this code you first run:
```bash
python main.py
```
After choosing your preferred algorithm. You can chose A for A*, B for Breadth first. Further you will be asked to chose between chip 1 and 2 and then for a netlist. 0-3 for chip 1 and 4-6 for chip 2. The code will now look for a solution for the chosen netlist.

Option C for Hillclimber can be chosen after first running either A* or Breadth First first. The Hillclimber algorithm will try to lower the connection cost of the already made netlist by A* or Breadth First if possible.

Below an example of the results given by A* and after running that solution through Hillclimber
![Solution given by A* pushing all connections up.](pics/Figure_2.png) ![New solution of A* after running it through Hillclimber.](pics/Figure_1.png)

At the end of each search a window will pop up with a visualisation of the found solution containing all gates and the connections between them as shown above.
