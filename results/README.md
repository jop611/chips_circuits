### Explanation of folder
This folder is divided into 2 maps: **print_1** & **print_2**. Each of these folders is divided into **a_star** &  **hillclimb**.
These folders contain the results obtained from running the program depending on which netlist you choose. An example of a result can be: netlist_1_719.
The first number after the first underscore represent the netlist that was used. The second number after the second underscore represent the score. 
If you click on these result files you can see the order in which the netlist was solved. After that you can see the path of each connection & at the end you can see the heuristics that were used to obtain the result.
